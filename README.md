Diffusion models are the new state-of-art generative models that are used for image synthesis. They are called Denoise Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs) and are considered as score-based generative models.
The main goal of that models is to generate/synthetize image from noise by reversing the process. The learning process is composed of a forward stochastic differential equation (SDE) that consist in converting data(images) slowly into noise.
